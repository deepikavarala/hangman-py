## Stage 4/8: Help is on the way

### Description
Now our game has become quite hard, and your chances of guessing the word depend on the size of the list. In our case with four words, there is only a 25% chance, so let's have mercy on the player and add a hint for them.

### Objectives
As in the previous stage, you should use the following word list: 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'
Show the first 3 letters after the computer chose a word from the list. Hidden letters should be replaced with hyphens ("-").
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.

Example 1
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word jav-: > java
You survived!
```
Example 2
```
H A N G M A N
Guess the word pyt---: > pythia
You are hanged!
```
